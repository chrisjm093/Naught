Naught is a news aggregator and statistics tracking app that displays coronavirus statistics and news headlines. The client specifies a date between 12/31/2019 and the present, a country or US state, and a publication, and the correlating data for that chosen day is displayed. The date can be entered in manually or chosen on a slider. This app gives users the ability to associate reported statistics with the historical news of the day, starting from the first reported case of the novel coronavirus to the present day.
